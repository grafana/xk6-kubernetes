# xk6-kubernetes
A k6 extension for interacting with Kubernetes clusters while testing. Built for [k6](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6) using [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6).

</div>

## Build

To build a `k6` binary with this extension, first ensure you have the prerequisites:

- [Go toolchain](https://go101.org/article/go-toolchain.html)
- Git

Then:

1. Download `xk6`:
  ```bash
  $ go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest
  ```

2. Build the binary:
  ```bash
  $ xk6 build --with github.com/k6io/xk6-kubernetes
  ```

## Development

To make development a little smoother, you may run the build script provided in the root folder. It will create a k6 binary with your local code rather than from GitHub.

```bash
$ ./build.sh && ./k6 run my-test-script.js
```

## Example

```javascript
import { Kubernetes } from 'k6/x/kubernetes';

export default function () {
  kubernetes = new Kubernetes()
  console.log(`${kubernetes.pods.list()} Pods found:`)
}
```

Result output:

```plain
$ ./k6 run script.js

          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /‾‾/   
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /    
    /  \/    \    |     (   /   ‾‾\  
   /          \   |  |\  \ |  (‾)  |
