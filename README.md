To build a `k6` binary with this extension, first ensure you have the prerequisites:

- [Go toolchain](https://go101.org/article/go-toolchain.html)
- Git

Then:

1. Download `xk6`:
  ```bash
  $ go get -u github.com/k6io/xk6
  ```

2. Build the binary:
  ```bash
  $ xk6 build --with github.com/k6io/xk6-kubernetes
  ```

## Example

```javascript
import kubernetes from 'k6/x/kubernetes';

export default function () {
  kubernetes.init()
  console.log(`${kubernetes.getPods()} Pods found:`)
}
```

Result output:

```plain
$ ./k6 run script.js
